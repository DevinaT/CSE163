## Using Our Repository

To use our repository, open gitbash or terminal on your computer and git clone the https link located on the repository. After this,
the repository file folder should be cloned onto your laptop and you can open up the contents in visual studio code. There are three
files you can run to produce graph output:

- devina_questions.py
- niyat_questions.py
- claire_questions.py

To run tests on our code (prove that it is in fact working) you may run the test file and look for any error output (there shouldn't be any)

- test_file.py
